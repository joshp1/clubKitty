### Story outline/ideas (Don't have to follow perfectly (Edit as needed))

- [x] A man is in a dinner watching the news on a over head TV eating a donut and drinking coffee. When a woman comes on saying, "A new pedoclub has opened on the west side please parents remember the owners act like it's healthy but keep your kids safe and far away. They're is a bill going threw congress that will outlaw this clubs like they should be"
- [x] He puts his cup down and rolls his eyes saying, "Fuck just let them be. It ain't like they force people to do it" a few people scoot away from him with weird looks.
- [x] A mom and daughter walk back the girl about nine is wearing a pony tell carrying a open book back when she walks into him
- [x] He looks down and sees she dropped a headband with cat ears picks it up and chases her outside giving it to her.
- [x] The mom says thinks and she blushes. The man smiles and says, "I think it's cute you like to wear that can I see you with it on?
- [x] She giggles and says, "Sorry I can't outside the club then drops a card and her and her mom leave
- [x] He sits back inside and finishes his coffee. Everyone has went on with their business
- [x] He reads the card.
  - [x] The top says, "The playpen"
  - [x] Below that is says, "Where all the cute cats are"
  - [x] He rolls his eyes
  - [x] then there is a phone number nothing else
- [x] He goes home and calls the number
- [x] A woman answers in a bored voice, "How meow I help you?"
- [x] He rolls his eyes with a laugh and says, "A girl around nine dropped a card after I helped her I'm just calling to see what you are
- [x] The woman replies, "We are. A loli club where all the cute cats are"
- [x] He sighs and says, "I can read your logo but what are you?"
- [x] The woman replies, "A loliclub you know like clubloli but we let the girls play as kittens or cats. They also dress like them. If you got a card that means one of the girls liked you and wants you to play" In a voice that says, I hate my job she says, "Play means visit and maybe join"
- [x] He gets a pen and paper out and says, "Ok where are you located"
- [x] in the same bored voice she gives him the address then says, "I hope you come and have a purrrrfect day"
- [x] She hangs up. He puts his phone down a little horny and goes and jacks off.
- [x] When he gets there he sees what looks like a old restraunt. 
- [x] The building is all white with in big letters a sign that says, "The playpen" the awning that sticks out has two  furry cat ears on top of it.
- [x] Once he's enters nervously he's ushered into a room. It's empty except for two meant that are creepily over happy.
- [x] They talk to him making it clear they just walked in and are there just for sex with the girls
- [x] A bolding skinny one says, "Hey I was told to sit out here a few days ago. I've been coming here everyday and no one has came out me and Jimmy have created a game want to play?" 
- [x] He shakes his head and he says, "Your loss it's real fun"
- [x] After a bit more of attempting to guilt him to join. A girl walks in.Smiles cutely and motions with her index and says, "Follow meow" 
- [x] HE can't help but smile he gets up and the other two follow.
- [x] A big man lets  him pass then he hears, "Back in there or I'll call the cops. A short second he hears what sounds like the bold one screaming, "No please no no no". as the sound gets faint. Till he can tell the man was taken outside.
- [x] He says, "I hope he ain't getting beat up." The girl says, "He's being thrown" He looks down. She looks up mostly with her eyes giving him a cute look and says, "He actually throws them it looks fun"
- [x] He can't help but like what he's looking at. It's the same girl from earlier, but she's wearing a white t-shit with a black cat on front of the shirt with the clubs name above it. She's also wearing a mid thigh black skirt. She has a black hair band with black ears and a black tail that is hanging from inside her skit to below her knees" He light brown hair and brown eyes and round face just makes her look cuter.
- [x] She takes him to a bar and says, "You can call me whiskers" He smiles and says he's name. they talk for a bit then she says, "I'm only allowed to talk for thirty minutes I'm afraid I'll b in trouble for talking to long" He frowns and says, "Sorry don't want to get you in trouble" She giggles and says, "I can show you around if you like. I'm allowed to do that."
- [x] Curious he asks what happens if you get in trouble.
- [x] She frowns and says, "We go in time out"
- [x] concerned he asks, "What happens in there"
- [x] In a voice full of attitude she says, "It's a boring white room with a hard black couch we sit in there for our alloted time. each time it we get in trouble the time is longer. I'm happy though they said when Clubloli started the owner would rape the girls. nothing like that happens here.
- [x] He sighs with relief and lets her take him on the tour
- [x] SHe takes him on the tour showing him what she calls the play area. it's just a bunch of balls and other toys with some girls bouncing some against the wall and others tossing them around some batting them around like a real cat"
- [x] The girl looks at him and rolls her eyes, "Some girls get really into character", points, "especially buttercup"
- [x] She shows him the rest of the club
- [x] After she's done a man walks out and says, "I need to talk to you in a private room if you want to stay otherwise you have to leave now"
- [x] The man nods following him with no more questions
- [x] Inside a small room with just a round table with two chairs across from each other. The man is told to sit on one side while the other sits on the other.
- [x] They go threw a bunch of stuff like things they found in his past. and then he sighs a waver so they can do a background check
- [x] After their done he says, "You can sit at the bar with whiskers if she likes. If she don't you can have a drink then leave. It takes two weeks to get the background 
Check back. If you don't hear from us don't come asking because we didn't like something we saw."
- [x] The man asks what if whiskers does want to sit with me? The other man replies, "You can stay as long as she wants you to. But after you leave you can't come back till the report is done"
- [x] The man agrees then goes back to the bar. were whiskers the girl from earlier sits beside him. to a bit of his relief.
- [x] She's happy he came and they talk a bit. When he can tell she's wanting to do something else he says goodbye to her and she says, "Hopefully see you in a couple of weeks"
- [x] two weeks later the man he talks to knocks on his door. When the man answers it he's handed a piece of paper then the man from before leaves
- [x] The paper is a letter headed invitation. THe letter head has The Play pen with two cat ears on the top at the edges below in the letter is says, "We've thoroughly checked your background and it seems you are a good candidate for membership. Starting today you have a  month trial membership if we don't like you. This membership is revoked It says more stuff like if he don't like the club just leave don't make a scene. your not obligated to stay. at the bottom there is a list of three things with prices first is a yearly membership with a hundred and three hundred dollars beside it. then monthly with thirty dollars beside that.

*I'm stopping here with the thorough ideas but I need to get names for the main characters and a main plot*

*Needs some story here maybe as much as five chapter before starting below*

- [ ] First she takes him to her room at the club
- [ ] They have to keep the door open. They're not allowed to have sex at the club they have to do that somewhere else. But they can get under the covers and sexually message each other. But they have to b under the covers and no oral sex though she gives him short blow jobs out of the thrill she may get caught.
- [ ] Also people of his neighborhood find out that he's going to the club and begins giving him problems.
- [ ] The problems grow when he begins taking her home. They call the cops they come pick her up and first time arrest him.
- [ ] Her parents has to tell them there not pressing charges that he has their permission to take her home.
