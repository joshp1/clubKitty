# Chapter 1
Kyle Daniels is sitting in a dinner watching the news on a large television on the wall. He's a thirty year old average build man with a short crop beard. The side effect of a few days on the road. His job most days is him in a cubical entering data into a database. About once a month it requires him to go on the road for a few days.

He just got in from a trip and decided to go in to get a sandwich. A tradition he started on his first business trip as a way to relax from being on the road. A man sitting beside him nudges him and says, "You come in here a lot?" Kyle shrugs and says, "When I get in from a long trip. I like to come in here." The man smiles and says, "So long enough to know if she's taken?", pointing at a blond waitress behind the counter.

She's got a decent size chest from what he can guess probably DD, a slim body. She would look very hot to him specially in the dinners uniform of a blue cloth skirt and white button up shirt that she keeps button half way down to show cleavage.

What has his attention though is a girl around nine sitting with her mom beside him, and the real reason he's watching the tv. He couldn't tell anyone what was playing on it. He's been watching the girl who's also wearing a blue skirt but with a pink t-shirt and her hair pulled back in a hair band. He knows he can never go with her or would want to. He couldn't imagine messing with her innocence. 

He loves how her and her mom are whispering giggling between themselves. Well he guesses she's her mom even though she her self looks pretty young. He decides most likely she's a babysitter or her sister.

The man beside him interrupts him again saying, "Sorry to interrupt you watching the news but do you think you could do me a favor?" Kyle frowns and says, "OK what?" The man says, "I'm kind of a shy man. Could you maybe" Kyle rolls his eyes and says, "I don't play matchmaker, sorry." The man gets mad stands up and leaves saying, "Dick head"

The waitress walks over and to fill his drink and says, "Thank you that jerk comes in here every day trying to get people to ask me out. I can't say anything to him because my job but I'm married with a 3 yr old boy. Hell he saw me pregnant that's how long he's been coming in here. Kyle nods and says, "Your welcome" Not knowing what else to say. She smiles and goes back to her job.

He turns his head to the disappointment of seeing the girl and her sister standing up and leaving. The girl picks up he duffle bag but a headband falls out. Her and her sister leave fast so he picks up the band and chases after. After waiving and saying, "I promise to be right back" He then runs out the door stopping the two as their getting into a car that's parked outside on the road.

He hands the hair band to her noticing the cat ears on top. Which he can't help but smile and think, "That's cute" She smiles and says, "Thank you", in a innocent voice.

She gets in and closes the door. He notices a something that looks like a business card fall before the door shuts and they leave. He leans down to the road and picks up the card out of curiosity sticks it in his pocket then goes back in.

Inside the waitress smiles and says, "Glad you came back I was about to call the cops" She is smiling though. She then leans in and says, "So cute you ran out there just to give that girl her hair band" He shrugs and says, "I know how kids get attached to stuff" He don't know what he did it really maybe one last chance to see the girl. That every time he looked at he can feel a tingle all over his body.

She gets his check and jots something else down on it. When he sees her phone number beside zero dollars on it below that is says, "On the house" Below the phone number is says, "Call me" 

He looks up and says, "I thought you where married" She shows him her ring finger with no band on or no tan line and says, "He left me when I had my baby". Kyle nods and says, "Thanks for the food", then leaves

On the way home he pulls out the card thinking it's the girl's sister's business card. He smiles and says, "Helping out her older sister. She's sweet" He looks down at the card and sees something he wasn't expecting. It says, "The playpen" Below that is a phone number. below that in small italics is says, "If someone dropped this near you call this number

He sticks the card in his pocket scarred that he was caught and in trouble. Then the idea why would she be laughing? He shakes his head and walks faster home
